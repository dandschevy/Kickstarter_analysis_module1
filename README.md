# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The challenge assignment for module 1 focused on building skills related to managing and analyzing data sets using pivot tables, charts, 
and graphical representations. There are two specific analysis to be created from the available data for theatrical activities;
one based on the funds raised goal; one based on launch date. 


### Purpose
The purpose of the two analysis was to determine how different theatrical campaigns performed based on the funds raised and the launch dates. 
This report will detail the findings of each outcome, provide a graphical representation of each outcome, outline the difficulties experienced
(or difficulties one could experience), and the final conclusions based on the analysis.  


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For this analysis, a pivot table was created filtering on the parent category "theater" and all years.  The columns consisted of the outcomes 
"successful", "failed", and canceled; "live" was excluded.  The row labels consisted of the months each theatrical activity was launch.  Once the 
pivot table was completed, a line chart was created in order to easily visualize the results of the analysis.   

Based on the chart below, May was the peak of successful theater launches during the twelve months with an appearance of a normal distribution graph.  
The failed launches were a bit more consistent throughout the year, although a little higher in the summer months, with dips in May and September and a 
spike in October.  Canceled outcomes were the largest in January and then were primarily flat with dips in July and October.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
For this analysis, a chart was created based on the goal amount and then calculating a percentage based on the number of successes, failures and cancelations
